      <h1>Slains Castle </h1>
      <p>On the coast of Cruden Bay lie the remains of Slains Castle.
        The original castle has been reconstructed may times since
        its construction in 1597 by the Earl of Erroll.
      </p>
      <p>
        This castle ruin is located close to cliff edges which can be dangerous.
        Keep to the surrounding paths, stay away from cliff edges and do not
        climb on any of the castle structure. Do not take any unnecessary risks.
      </p>
      <p>
        The castle is famous for many reasons, partly because it was a
        place where celebrities were entertained on numerous occasions in the 19th Century.

          <p>The ruin you see today is the inevitable result of the castleâ€™s location
            and various misfortunes becoming the owners over time. The owners, the Earls
            of Errol, were an influential family in the Cruden Bay area for many years and
            prospered after William Hay (the 18th Earl of Errol) married the daughter of
            King William IV. Overtime the Hays fell upon hard times and in 1919 the castle
            and contents were sold to Sir John Ellerman. He gave up the castle in 1925
            and the roof was removed to avoid paying taxes.</p>

            Most notable being, Bram Stoker and it is believed the castle is the inspiration
            for the setting of the tale in Count Dracula (1897). The Crown (2016 -) fans
            will also recognise Slains Castle. In Season 1 the castle stood in for Castle
            Mey when the Queen Mother goes to Scotland. </p>
