      <h1>Dunnottar Castle </h1>
      <p>Dunnottar Castle is a dramatic and evocative ruined cliff top fortress
        that was the home of the Earls Marischal, once one of the most powerful
        families in Scotland. Steeped in history, this romantic and haunting ruin
        is a photographer’s paradise, a history lover’s dream and an iconic
        tourist destination for visitors the world over.
      </p>
      <p>
        In October 2020, Dunnottar Castle was ranked second in the
        top five best castles in the UK by Cottages and Castles
        based on TripAdvisor reviews
      </p>
      <p>
        Dunnottar – an impregnable fortress that holds many rich secrets of Scotland’s colourful past!

          <p>Dunnottar Castle is one of North-east Scotland's most
            iconic locations so it's only natural that filmmakers can't resist its cinematic appeal.</p>
          <hr class="header-break">
          <p>The castle inspired Zeffirelli's adaption of the Shakespeare classic Hamlet (1990)
            starring Oscar winner, Mel Gibson during which it doubled as 16th century Denmark.
            Then in 2012 when the Disney Pixar's animators behind the Oscar-winning Brave
            visited Dunnottar Castle they were so mesmerised by it that they altered their
            original plans for Merida's family castle, DunBroch, to be moved from a loch in
            the Highlands to an outpost by the sea. Dunnottar Castle also appeared in the 2015
            adaptation of Victor Frankenstein starring Daniel Radcliffe
            and James McAvoy and showed off its creepier side. </p>
