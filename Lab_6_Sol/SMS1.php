 * Aberdeen is the home of specs, mugs and sausage rolls. You are only allowed to:
 *      buy specs if you are over 16,
 *      buy mugs if you are over 18,
 *      and buy sausage rolls if you are over 21
 * Create a web page that stores a personâ€™s age at the top in a variable called $myage. The page will then use PHP to print out their name and use an if/elseif/else statement to print out which of the three items they are allowed to buy.
